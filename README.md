# CountryArrays
This project uses arrays to display data about the production of fruit in certain countries.

There was two different files, one listing 10 countries with the number of apples they produced and a similar one but with the number of oranges they produced. The goal was to create a 2D array with 10 rows and 2 columns for the countries that produced apples and one for who produced oranges. As well as another 2D array but with the numbers of apples and oranges in its corresponding column. I used four functions, one called SetValues() which created the columns and rows, getMost() which looked for the country that produced the most oranges and apples, getLeast() that looked for the countries that produced the least fruit, and both() that looked for the top producers in both categories.

Console Window with output will be found in Issues.
